   yarn start
   ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the app in action.

## State Management

The app uses React Context for global state management, including donations, totals, and configurations. Configuration data is persisted in `localStorage`.

6. `DonationPopup` - Notification when new donation arrives
7. `GoalReachedOverlay` - Celebration screen
8. `ConfettiEffect` - Visual celebration animations
9. `ConfigPanel` - Settings and test controls

## Key Functionality

1. **Donation Processing**
   - Manual test donations
   - API-connected donations
   - Update thermometer and list

2. **API Integration**
   - WordPress/Gravity Forms API connection
   - Authentication
   - Periodic fetching

3. **Responsive Design**
   - Scale entire app to maintain 1920Ã—1080 aspect ratio

4. **Effects & Animations**
   - Thermometer fill animation
   - Confetti displays based on donation size
   - Popups and celebrations

5. **Configuration**
   - API settings
   - Goal amount adjustments
   - Field mappings
   - Refresh intervals

## Custom Hooks

- `useAPI` - API connection
- `useScale` - Responsive scaling

## Implementation Order

1. Core UI components
2. State management
3. Thermometer visualization
4. Donation handling
5. API connections
6. Animations and effects
7. Configuration panel

## Deployment

### Using GitHub Actions

This project includes a GitHub Action workflow to automatically build and deploy the React app to GitHub Pages.

1. Ensure your repository has a `gh-pages` branch. If not, create one:

   ```bash
   git checkout --orphan gh-pages
   git reset --hard
   git commit --allow-empty -m "Initialize gh-pages branch"
   git push origin gh-pages
   ```

2. The GitHub Action workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/static.yml`. It will run on every push to the `main` branch and deploy the build output to the `gh-pages` branch.

3. To trigger the deployment manually, you can use the "Run workflow" button in the Actions tab of your GitHub repository.
